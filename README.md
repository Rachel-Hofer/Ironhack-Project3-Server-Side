1.Technical Requirements
Your app must:

Have at least 4 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing a User of your application, and three that contribute to the core business logic of your app. These models also should have some type of relationship.
Include sign-up / sign-in / sign-out functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
Utilize Mongoose to create your models and add the proper validations.
Have a RESTful API that will be called from the client side to display data.
Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process.
Have a Responsive Design, we recommend you start mobile-first and then build up for larger screen sizes!
Create your React components that will implement all the features of your project.
Be deployed online and accessible to the public, with a .co domain that ironhack will provide you.
Necessary Deliverables
User Stories, in Trello, following Kanban.
Wireframes of your app, These can be done with pen and paper, whiteboard, or tools such as Sketch (for the daring).
Project Presentation, done with slides.com.
A working MERN stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet (likely Heroku) with a .co domain that Ironhack will provide to you.
A link to your hosted working application in the URL section of your GitHub repo.
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
A Git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project.
